<p>rapid7: Continuing on the browser vulnerabilities front, we continue to emphasize the importance of good security practices and hygiene in not clicking (or installing) random links (applications). 5 of the 11 Critical RCEs noted this month (CVE-2020-1213, CVE-2020-1216, <b>CVE-2020-1219</b>, CVE-2020-1073, CVE-2020-1260) are browser based and can be heavily mitigated via good practices.  Despite this, it is always better to patch as situations like CVE-2020-1213 (which is a VBScript RCE where an attacked could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization") can and often do occur.</p>

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution with the same permissions as the current user. There are multiple scenarios where an attacker could exploit these flaws. They include convincing a user to visit a malicious or compromised website, or open a malicious Microsoft Office document.</p>
<p>rapid7: Continuing on the browser vulnerabilities front, we continue to emphasize the importance of good security practices and hygiene in not clicking (or installing) random links (applications). 5 of the 11 Critical RCEs noted this month (<b>CVE-2020-1213</b>, <b>CVE-2020-1216</b>, CVE-2020-1219, CVE-2020-1073, <b>CVE-2020-1260</b>) are browser based and can be heavily mitigated via good practices.

<li>Windows SMB (<a style="color:orange;" href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1301">CVE-2020-1301</a>)</li>
<p>tenable: <b>CVE-2020-1301</b> is an RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) protocol due to the way it handles certain requests. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. Exploitation of this vulnerability would require the attacker to be authenticated and send a specially crafted packet to the target SMBv1 server.</p>
<p>rapid7: Last, but not least, I want to acknowledge the SMBv3 vulnerabilities being addressed this month, and one interesting OpenSSH (CVE-2020-1292 - AttackerKB entry) privilege escalation vulnerability.  CVE-2020-0796 (initially Security Advisory ADV200005), disclosed back in March 2020, is now seeing functional PoCs targeting unpatched systems.  Part of this process has been to pivot off local privilege escalation, something that CVE-2020-1292 can provide a means of accomplishing.  Strictly on the SMBv3 side, these vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1206, CVE-2020-1284) continue to affect only Windows 10 variants on Version 1903 onwards.  There is commonality between all these vulnerabilities however, and it is that mitigation can be accomplished via disabling SMBv3 compression, which is stated as having no negative performance impact (yet).  There are patches, and patches will always be a solid strategy, but it's nice to know what the alternatives could be.  As for <b>CVE-2020-1301</b> (AttackerKB entry), an SMBv1 remote code execution vulnerability -- please consider disabling SMBv1 if it's not a mission critical component of your infrastructure, or at least have a migration plan in place.</p>

<p>tenable: <b>CVE-2020-1284</b> is a DoS vulnerability that exists due to the manner in which the Microsoft Server Message Block 3.1.1 (SMBv3) protocol handles certain requests. This flaw can be exploited on an authenticated server or against an SMB client. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the target system to crash. An authenticated attacker would need to send a specially crafted packet to exploit this vulnerability against a vulnerable SMB server. To target an SMB client, an attacker would need to host a maliciously configured SMBv3 server and convince the client to connect to it.</p>

<p>tenable: <b>CVE-2020-1181</b> is an RCE vulnerability found in Microsoft SharePoint Server. The vulnerability exists in the way that SharePoint Server mishandles ASP.net requests, allowing an authenticated attacker to execute code as the application’s pool process. The attacker would need to invoke a malicious page from the SharePoint server in order to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>qualys: A remote code execution vulnerability (<b>CVE-2020-1181</b>) is patched in Sharepoint Server that would allow an authenticated user on a guest system to perform security actions for an application pool process. Microsoft notes that exploitation of this vulnerability is less likely, but these patches should still be prioritized for all SharePoint servers.</p>
<p>rapid7: In terms of urgency, critical remote execution vulnerabilities are typically choice patches to prioritize.  Luckily this month, of the 11 Critical RCE vulnerabilities, 10 can be remediated via Operating System patches.  The remaining <b>CVE-2020-1181</b> is a SharePoint patch which would be more dependent on your environment.</p>

Exploitation of this vulnerability would require an attacker to convince a victim to open a specially crafted cabinet file or alternatively spoof a network printer and convince a user to install a malicious cabinet file by disguising it as another file, such as a printer driver.</p>
<p>qualys: Microsoft has also released a fix for a Windows vulnerability (<b>CVE-2020-1300</b>) that could lead to Remote Code Execution vulnerability. This would allow an attacker to trick a user to open a specially crafted cabinet file, thereby installing malicious file that appears to be a printer driver. Based on the information given, this should be prioritized across all Windows servers and workstations.</p>
<p>zdi: <b>CVE-2020-1300</b> – Windows Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This patch corrects a vulnerability in the processing of cabinet files. An attacker could get code execution by convincing a user to open a specially crafted CAB file. They could also spoof a network printer and dupe a user into installing the specially crafted CAB file disguised as a printer driver. Users are often conditioned into trusting printer drivers when offered one, so it would not be surprising to see this get exploited.</p>
<li>Windows OLE (<a style="color:red;" href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1281">CVE-2020-1281</a>)</li>
<p>qualys: The Browser, Scripting Engine, LNK files (CVE-2020-1299), GDI+(CVE-2020-1248) and OLE (<b>CVE-2020-1281</b>) should be prioritized for workstation-type devices, meaning any system that is used for email or to access the internet via a browser. This includes multi-user servers that are used as remote desktops for users.</p>
<p>qualys: A remote code execution vulnerability (<b>CVE-2020-1281</b>) is patched in Windows OLE (Object Linking and Embedding). This would allow an attacker to convince a user to open a specially crafted file or program form email or webpage, and executing malicious code on the host system. All Windows OLE installations should prioritized for patching.</p>
<p>zdi: <b>CVE-2020-1281</b> – Windows OLE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This bug allows an attacker to exploit code on a target system if they can convince a user to open a specially crafted file or program. Since this involves OLE data structures, multiple file types could be used by the attacker. Considering this impacts every supported version of Windows put this one near the top of your test and deploy list.</p>

<p>tenable: <b>CVE-2020-1286</b> is an RCE vulnerability due to the Windows Shell not properly validating file paths. An attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on a host, subject to the privileges of the current user account. An attacker must entice a user to open a specially crafted file or visit a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.</p>

<p>rapid7: Last, but not least, I want to acknowledge the SMBv3 vulnerabilities being addressed this month, and one interesting OpenSSH (<b>CVE-2020-1292</b> - AttackerKB entry) privilege escalation vulnerability.  CVE-2020-0796 (initially Security Advisory ADV200005), disclosed back in March 2020, is now seeing functional PoCs targeting unpatched systems.  Part of this process has been to pivot off local privilege escalation, something that <b>CVE-2020-1292</b> can provide a means of accomplishing.  Strictly on the SMBv3 side, these vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1206, CVE-2020-1284) continue to affect only Windows 10 variants on Version 1903 onwards.  There is commonality between all these vulnerabilities however, and it is that mitigation can be accomplished via disabling SMBv3 compression, which is stated as having no negative performance impact (yet).  There are patches, and patches will always be a solid strategy, but it's nice to know what the alternatives could be.  As for CVE-2020-1301 (AttackerKB entry), an SMBv1 remote code execution vulnerability -- please consider disabling SMBv1 if it's not a mission critical component of your infrastructure, or at least have a migration plan in place.</p>
